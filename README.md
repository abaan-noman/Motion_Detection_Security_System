# Motion_Detection_Security_System
The Motion Detection Security System is a Python application designed to detect and record motion in real-time using a camera feed. It offers various features, including motion detection, video recording, and a user interface for managing recordings.

To use the system, ensure you have a compatible operating system such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux, along with Python version 3 installed. Additionally, you'll need to install the required libraries, including tkinter and OpenCV. Installation is straightforward; simply follow the steps outlined in the installation section of the provided user manual.

Once installed, executing the application involves running the main.py file. The program will then continuously monitor the camera feed for motion. Pressing the "q" key stops the recording process.

The user interface provides options such as real-time video viewing, accessing recorded videos, and clearing recordings. To access these features, log in with the provided username and password.

In case of any issues, troubleshoot by ensuring the camera is properly connected and there's adequate lighting. Verify Python and library installations for compatibility.

While the system offers effective motion detection and recording capabilities, it's essential to note its known limitations. Compatibility issues may arise with older Python or OpenCV versions, and lighting conditions can impact accuracy.

In conclusion, the Motion Detection Security System provides a reliable solution for motion detection and recording tasks. For further assistance or inquiries, feel free to reach out to the developers listed below:
